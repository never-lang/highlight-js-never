Never is a simple functional programming language. Technically it may be 
classified as syntactically scoped, strongly typed, call by value, 
functional programming language.

In practise Never offers basic data types, assignment, control flow, arrays, 
first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it useful 
to calculate expressions. Also it demonstrates how functions can be compiled,
invoked and passed as parameters or results between other functions.
